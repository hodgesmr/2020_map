## Setup

I built this using Python 3.9, but it probably works with Python 3.6 or later.

Before you get going, you probably need to install [GDAL](https://gdal.org/) on your system. There are lots of ways to do that, but if you're on a Mac, the easiest is with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```sh
brew install gdal
```

Then, you likely want a Python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), and install the requirements:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
