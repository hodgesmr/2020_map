# 2020_map

## Setup

I built this using Python 3.9, but it probably works with Python 3.6 or later.

Before you get going, you probably need to install [GDAL](https://gdal.org/) on your system. There are lots of ways to do that, but if you're on a Mac, the easiest is with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```sh
brew install gdal
```

Then, you likely want a Python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), and install the requirements:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

To generate a map to the `output/` directory:

```sh
python build_map.py
```

## Fonts

This project uses the [Futura font](https://github.com/hodgesmr/2020_map/blob/main/build_map.py#L88), which is a system font on macOS. If you don't have Futura on your system, it will fall back to a different font and your image will look different.

## Keep the Faith!

Faith was one of the core values of the [2020 Biden Campaign Code](https://web.archive.org/web/20201102041950/https://joebiden.com/joes-codes/):

>What I mean by faith in this sense is a belief that you can do extraordinary things, whatever the odds. When I would walk out of my Grandpa Finnegan’s house in Scranton, he would tell me, “Joey, keep the faith.” My grandmother would always yell back, “no, Joey, spread it—spread the faith!” On our campaign, “keep the faith” has always been more than just a saying; it’s a call to keep moving forward, to keep believing, to keep doing what’s right even when the path ahead is murky and the goal feels far away. Through low lows and high highs, our campaign staff and volunteers have kept the faith as we pursued this nomination. We’ve never despaired, and never given up—and as long as we have faith, we never will.

On election night, when results were uncertain and millions of votes were still yet to be counted, Joe Biden had one message for supporters: [Keep the faith](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1323865811031785472).

A trace of President Biden's hand-written message is featured on this map.
